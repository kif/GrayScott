Great news: if you can see this message in your terminal, your Rust development
environment seems to be set up correctly.

This is the first of many examples featured in the "examples" directory, and the

their code somehow. Code comments inside of the source code of each example will
hint you in the right direction, while teaching you some Rust along the way."#
